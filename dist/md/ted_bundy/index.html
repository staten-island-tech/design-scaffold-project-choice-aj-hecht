    <p>What makes him different from most other serial killers was the way that he presented himself to the public. When you think of a serial killer, you think of a person who is withdrawn from society, an outcast. You may even envision someone who, since a child, has a deep hatred of humans and wishes to eradicate members of mankind one by one. However, this is not the case with many killers, and certainly not with Theodore Bundy.
Witnesses, friends, and survivors all categorize Ted and a kind, charismatic, and handsome young man. This is probably the reason why he got away with his malicious conduct for so long before he was convicted of his crimes. Before he began committing murders, he would display strange behavior, such as surrounding his sister with knives in her sleep and becoming very attached to his bigotted grandfather as a child.
When he was most active and initially convicted, Bundy managed to escape jail in Colorado and commit several more murders in Florida, where he was convicted again. Overall, we do not know for sure how many women Ted has killed. There are 20 confirmed cases, over 30 confessed, and several more suspected.</p>
