Ever since childhood, he was extremely intrigued in the preservation of animal remains and discovering what lay inside of their bodies. His disturbed hobbies were furthered by his alcoholism throughout the entirety of his adolescence.
Let’s rewind a bit: the origin of most of these killers’ doings is their upbringing… So let's dive into Dahmer’s unsettling childhood. His mother was a depressed, suicidal hypochondriac who had displayed several acts of infidelity to his father throughout their rocky relationship. He was withdrawn due to her chronic illnesses and used drinking as an outlet.
In earlier school years, he was seen as an outcast and a loner and later on, in high school, became a class clown in a desperate act for attention and validation from his peers. Very shortly after graduating high school, Dahmer committed his first murder, performing gruesome acts on the corpse. He later went on to have 16 more victims murdered in similar fashions and all mutilated post mortem. Once he was convicted and confessed to all of his crimes, he was bludgeoned to death by another prisoner.
