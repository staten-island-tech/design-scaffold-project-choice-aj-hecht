    <p>Walt used to be your ordinary high school chemistry teacher and part time car washer, and no one suspected the evil that lied dormant inside of him all along, not even him.
When Walt discovered that he had terminal cancer, he turned to producing and selling illegal substances (probably shouldn’t elaborate on that too much because this is a school assignment) with Jesse, a deadbeat old student of his. They soon discover that Walter’s advanced knowledge in chemistry provided them with an enormous advantage and they had created the best and purest stuff on the market. However, their competition wasn’t pleased with that.
Over the next few years, Walt spirals out of control and cannot stop himself, even when he’s in remission and had made more than enough money to support his family. We finally see his true colors, someone who thinks he’s destined to be the best at this. He’s determined to make this his legacy and do whatever he must and obliterate whoever he must in order to achieve his goals.
Now, it is difficult to pinpoint the amount of people he has actually killed throughout his time as Albuquerque's most wanted criminal because there were many deaths as a cause of his actions in addition to those which he committed directly. He has killed around 20 people himself over the course of his career, but if we were to count the people who died as a result of what he’s done, his murder count would be over 200. Even though Walter was known as a drug lord instead of a murderer, it’s safe to say that by technicality he can be considered a serial killer.</p>
