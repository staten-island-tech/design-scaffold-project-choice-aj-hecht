<p>Ever since childhood, he was extremely intrigued in the preservation of animal remains and discovering what lay inside of their bodies. His disturbed hobbies were furthered by his alcoholism throughout the entirety of his adolescence.
Let’s rewind a bit: the origin of most of these killers’ doings is their upbringing… So let's dive into Dahmer’s unsettling childhood. His mother was a depressed, suicidal hypochondriac who had displayed several acts of infidelity to his father throughout their rocky relationship.

Once he was convicted and confessed to all of his crimes, he was bludgeoned to death by another prisoner.</p>
